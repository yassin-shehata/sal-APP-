# sal-APP ðŸ§ªâš¡

A Python application for chloride sensor calibration, measurement, and data export.  
This project is a **full Python (PySide6 + Qt)** reimplementation of a MATLAB-based chloride sensor interface.  
It replicates **all features** of the original MATLAB App Designer code, including:

- âœ… System connection to Vernier GoDirect chloride sensors (with optional FakeSensor for simulation)  
- âœ… Real-time plotting of sensor voltage and calculated chloride concentration  
- âœ… Standard solution measurements (10 ppm, 100 ppm, 1000 ppm, 5000 ppm) with stability checks  
- âœ… Calibration curve fitting with RÂ² display  
- âœ… Sample measurements with chloride guideline criteria  
- âœ… Excel export of measurement and calibration data (using `openpyxl` and `pandas`)  
- âœ… Session recovery (restore, backup, or delete old data files)  
- âœ… Simulation mode for development/testing without hardware
